A library that generates an interactive radar, inspired by [thoughtworks.com/radar](http://thoughtworks.com/radar).

## Demo

https://radar.thoughtworks.com

plug in [this data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18A7oDuavlh89rAmqcaXpqle8QLqIvlAkoEUxcObzuUM/edit#gid=1985253373) to [visualize](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F18A7oDuavlh89rAmqcaXpqle8QLqIvlAkoEUxcObzuUM%2Fedit%23gid%3D1985253373).

### Set up

Data public in a form thoughtwors can digest; at least the below column headers, and using own content:

| name          | ring   | quadrant               | isNew | description                                             |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Composer      | adopt  | tools                  | TRUE  | Although the idea of dependency management ...          |
| Canary builds | trial  | techniques             | FALSE | Many projects have external code dependencies ...       |
| Apache Kylin  | assess | platforms              | TRUE  | Apache Kylin is an open source analytics solution ...   |
| JSF           | hold   | languages & frameworks | FALSE | We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF ... |

### Using CSV data

The other way to provide your data is using CSV document format.
You can enter any URL that responds CSV data into the input field on the first page.
The format is just the same as that of the Google Sheet, the example is as follows:

```
name,ring,quadrant,isNew,description
Composer,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Although the idea of dependency management ..."
Canary builds,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Many projects have external code dependencies ..."
Apache Kylin,assess,platforms,TRUE,"Apache Kylin is an open source analytics solution ..."
JSF,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF ..."
```

**_Note:_** The CSV file parsing is using D3 library, so consult the [D3 documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#csv) for the data format details.


### Building the radar

Paste the URL in the input field on the home page.

That's it!

**_Note:_** The quadrants of the radar, and the order of the rings inside the radar will be drawn in the order they appear in your data.

Check [this page](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/how-to-byor) for step by step guidance.

### Run with one line docker

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD:/app -w /app -it node:17.8.0 /bin/sh -c 'npm install && npm rebuild node-sass && npm run dev'`



After building it will start on `localhost:8080`
