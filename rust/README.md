    cargo new hello-rust

This will generate a new directory called hello-rust with the following files:

    hello-rust
    |- Cargo.toml
    |- src
      |- main.rs

Cargo.toml is the manifest file for Rust. It’s where you keep metadata for your project, as well as dependencies.

src/main.rs is where we’ll write our application code.

cargo new generates a "Hello, world!" project 

run this program by moving into the newly created directory and running:

    cargo run
